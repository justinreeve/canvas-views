This is a framework for modifying the functionality and style of Canvas.

Canvas loads canvas-production.min.js via $.addScript().

Canvas loads canvas-production.css via @import call. Also see https://canvas.instructure.com/styleguide

JSRender is used as the templating system, and loaded via grunt-js-render.

TODO: When development is stable, upload canvas-production.min.js and canvas-production.css directly to Canvas, so they can be cached locally and not retrieved from https://canvasassets.wsd.net.
